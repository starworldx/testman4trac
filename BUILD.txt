To build the four plugins that make up the application:


  On Linux:

 1) Make sure you have Trac installed and available in the Python lookup 
    path. Genshi should also be available in the Python lookup path.
    To make these libraries available to Python you can either install them
    centrally, or reference them using the PYTHONLIB environment variable.
    
    In order to enable languages different from English, you should also
    have Babel installed in your Python environment.
    
 2) Unzip the source code distribution package
 
 3) Open a shell, cd into the testman4trac-parent directory
    
 4) Build the source code using the provided build script:
    
        ./build.sh [-f] [-i path/to/your/trac/project/env]
        
        Where:
            -f :    fast: does not generate the localized message catalogs (you should build them at least on the first build run)
            -i :    installs the built plugins into your trac environment
 
    The build shell script can copy the resulting egg files into your desired 
    destination, by specifying the "-i" option.

 5) You will find the built egg files under the directory "bin" and the 
    documentation under "docs".
    
    
  On Windows:

 1), 2), 3) Same as for Linux
 4) Build the source code using the provided build scripts:
 
    - To build for Trac 0.12 and above:
 
        build.cmd
 
    The build shell script can copy the resulting egg files into your desired 
    destination.
    If you wish to directly install the egg files under your Trac environment, 
    you can do that by providing your project root directory to the build.cmd 
    script:
    
    build.cmd path\to\your\trac\project\env
    
 5) You will find the built egg files under the directory "bin" and the 
    documentation under "docs".

==============================================================================
Use the following command to clean up the build:

  On Linux:

    ./clean.sh

    
  On Windows:
    
    clean.cmd
