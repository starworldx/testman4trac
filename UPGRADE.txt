Upgrade is supported from release 1.4.7 and above only.

If you have an earlier release, upgrade to 1.4.7 first and then upgrade 
to the latest release.

The functionalities are divided in three plugins, which must be installed in 
this order:

    1) Trac Generic Class => TracGenericClass

    2) Trac Generic Workflow => TracGenericWorkflow

    3) Test Manager => TestManager


An additional plugin is only useful for debugging and should not be installed 
in a production environment.

    *  SQL Executor => SQLExecutor
